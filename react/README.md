# Description

This project was developed for a [competition](https://github.com/codante-io/rinha-frontend) that tasked participants with creating a JSON tree viewer, all while adhering to the constraint of not using server-side processing.

## Stack

The application is built using a React with TS and Vite.

## Results

I was able to visualize all the files (including the 200MB one that I wasn't able to push into github).
